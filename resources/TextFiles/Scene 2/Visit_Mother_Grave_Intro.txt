Never seen your mother, only hearing stories of how she was an outstanding doctor and a kind lady always helping others first before herself.

Your dad tells you she died giving birth to you.

Your relationship with your dad was a very unorthdox one

"sigh... I..I dont even know what to say"

"I know its not your fault and its mostly mine, but I sometimes think i would have been better off not coming into this world."

"You dont want to hear that, you want to hear all the tremendous things your son has done in life."

"I can't even say...."

"Sometimes I just sit and watch people enjoy there time with there family. Imagine having a normal family Dad, you and I."

"... sigh, I will be back mom."
